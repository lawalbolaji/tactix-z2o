## Features

## Running the application

The best way to use the app is to try it out here, but if you want to self host or run locally, here are a couple of ways to do that:

### Local Machine with nodejs

1. Clone the repo:

```sh
> git clone git@github.com:lawalbolaji/gpt-playground.git
```

2. In the project's root directory, run:

```sh
> cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. Get OpenAI API Key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and add those credentials to your `.env.local` file

4. Install NodeJs dependencies:

```sh
> npm ci
```

5. Boot up:

```sh
> npm run dev
```
